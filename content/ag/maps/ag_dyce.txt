Title:          DyCe
File name:      dyce.bsp

Background:     The year is 2000+ something, this bright chap called Derik finds that he
                has no room to keep his pet snails anymore, so he builds this arena (yes on his own)
                but before he can place his snails in the arena some big 'ard men come in and
                beat him till he dies. They cant decide who 0wnz the snail arena so they
                fight for it. So if you want the arena for your own you have to fight for it.
                eehh i named it Dyce cos the old man that made hit for his snails was called
                Derik Dyce... no i didnt just make all this up!

Singleplayer:   Just to look around
Deathmatch:     Yes
Teamplay:       NEIN
Players:        As many as you want, but its a 1v1 map

Information:    This is my first 1v1 map, and it shows i think, r_speeds are pretty pants in
                places cos i got carried away with the looks but if u got a fairly good pc it
                should play fine. There are a few rebounds, but nearly all maps have a few...
                i got rid of alot of them however.

Special Thanks: -Valve for making the best fps of all-time.
                -Bullit for making AG
